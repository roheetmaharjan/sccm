                <div class="content">
                    <p>If you are a Medicare card holder and wish to claim a rebate from Medicare it is required to have a referral from either your GP or another specialist. GP referral is preferred as it lasts 12 months, whereas a specialist referral is valid for 3 months only.
                    </p>
                    <p>Patients who do not wish to claim Medicare benefits or do not have Medicare do not need a referral.

                    <p>
                        No. Health Insurance unfortunately does not cover the costs of out of hospital expenses. But the advantage of having private health fund is that it may cover in hospital costs if you need any surgery.
