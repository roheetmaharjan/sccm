GP referral is preferred as it lasts 12 months, whereas a specialist referral is valid for 3 months only.

                                            No. Health Insurance unfortunately does not cover the costs of out of hospital expenses. But the advantage of having private health fund is that it may cover in hospital costs if you need any surgery.
